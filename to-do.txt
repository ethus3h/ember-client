HIGH PRIORITY EITE
- Get document rendering to be a bit more sophisticated (support variables and function calls inside documents)
- Get rendering through time working (right now it draws the completed document and stops running, rather than keeping it idle and having an event handling system, although I have started on the APIs for that)
- Provide a way for an EITE document to start a sub-document in its own thread
- Get data persistence
- EITE-based GUI
- EITE-based servers and service discovery
- Implement more Dc abilities, in sync with creating EITE interface and server documents (main loader and other documents) Each Dc will need  more work to be implemented in each input and output format, I guess. More work will be desirable for on how Dc data are represented.

LOW PRIORITY EITE
- possibly raster area output
- WASM compatibility in StageL
- FIXME: int32 in 8 bit cpu; comparison of bit operations by programming language; ceil/floor with negative numbers; effects of endianness
- Decentralization/IPFS/OrbitDB integration

OTHER
- Idea for StageL: Make things like "set as/arr push as/arr s/val" nicer to write: how about: ": push as/arr val"
- Stagel: fix "until" keyword
- Import in editor is broken.
- WebExt: button for swap between text and rendered; button to open in editor; editor open in tab option
