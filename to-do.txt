Just finished reworking all my code so far. It now has a much nicer API (e.g. if you include the now-single script file in an HTML page, all that's needed is to run loadAndRun('sems', 'idiomatic-hello-world.sems'); to run the specified document in the browser). It doesn't have any new capabilities, but it is much less awkward to use, better documented/structured/commented, and can be ported more easily to other platforms if desired (just add a new code generator frontend to the transpiler, and port the fairly small (~72 functions, <1k line) library of nonportable code).

Next I want to try getting a simple GUI (just HTML forms and JavaScript) for converting between Unicode and "EITE" (the new thing I'm working on) data formats, and for editing EITE data. Since the code is now wrapped up into a rather nicer library, it should be fairly trivial to get something like that working (although these things never seem to turn out as easy as I think they will). After that, I want to get document rendering to be a bit more sophisticated (support variables and function calls inside documents), get rendering through time working (right now it draws the completed document and stops running, rather than keeping it idle and having an event handling system, although I have started on the APIs for that), investigate Web Workers and get everything off the main thread (it runs asynchronously right now, but not in its own worker), provide a way for an EITE document to start a sub-document in its own thread, and get data persistence, an EITE-based GUI, and perhaps EITE-based servers and service discovery. That's quite a lot of things, though, and although it should all be technically possible, I'm not sure how far along in that list I'll get over the semester. I guess just a HTML GUI for people to play with the document format, and some more interesting abilities for the format, would be a nice start.
Anyway, I just wanted to give a bit of a status update on where this is at. Thanks! I hope your break has gone well; see you all in class!
WASM

Develop simple editing GUI
A few days to finish? Mostly just needs search box, Dc cats, and implement URL loading
Mostly works.
WASM compatibility in StageL
Finishing existing input and output formats not completed yet
A week??
More of this will probably end up in the next milestone if I don’t finish it for this one


Finish existing & simple output formats
 - plain text, character cells (mutable and immutable — add terminal type as an environment property like encoding), (probably SEMS, if I fix import) especially
Will need porting of the unit test code from bash but that shouldn’t be hard
Implement more output formats
- possibly raster area output
Only a couple are available
Provide more input format(s); start with text & then maybe StageL
A week?

Implement more Dc abilities, in sync with creating EITE interface and server documents (main loader and other documents)
Lots of work. This is where most of the remaining effort will be. Probably months.
Each Dc will need  more work to be implemented in each input and output format, I guess. More work will be desirable for on how Dc data are represented.

# FIXME: int32 in 8 bit cpu; comparison of bit operations by programming language; ceil/floor with negative numbers; effects of endianness; are script tags executed in order

Idea for StageL: Make things like "set as/arr push as/arr s/val" nicer to write: how about: ": push as/arr val"

Import in editor is broken.

# WebExt: button for swap between text and rendered; button to open in editor; editor open in tab option
Hi! I'm starting work on using IPFS-JS in a project I'm developing. The project needs to have multiple computers able to share and keep synchronized with each other a large (in both number and size) ordered set of blobs, without a centralized server,
