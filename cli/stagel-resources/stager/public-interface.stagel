# This file contains the public interface for EITE.

# If you just want to run EITE, use the following function.

r/v/startEite
    # Start EITE, using the default startup document. Does not return while EITE is still running.
    # loadAndRun ...


# If you want to run a different document, you can call loadAndRun with the format of the document to open and its location.

r/v/loadAndRun s/format s/path
    # Load and run the specified document. Does not return while the document is still running.
    runDocument loadStoredDocument s/format s/path


# If you want to convert a document to another format, you can call loadAndConvert with the format of the document, its location, and the format you want the results in.

r/v/loadAndConvert s/inputFormat s/path s/outputFormat
    # Load the specified document, and return it converted to the specified outputFormat.
    convertDocument loadStoredDocument s/inputFormat s/path


# To operate on a document you already have as a Dc array, you can call runDocument or convertDocument directly on it.

r/v/runDocument an/contents
    # Run the specified document. Does not return while the document is still running. Takes care of events and I/O automatically.

    internalRunDocument an/contents

r/an/convertDocument an/contents s/format
    assertIsSupportedOutputFormat s/format

# If you want more control over the document loading and execution, you can use these lower-level functions.
